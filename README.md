# kaleidoscope

`kaleidoscope` is an R package developed to visualize PLEXOS scenarios as packaged by the [`rplexos`](https://github.com/NREL/rplexos) R package. The package provides three types of visualizations intended to be used as coordinated views: a geographic diagram, a chord diagram, and dispatch charts. The geographic diagram provides a qualitative view of the study domain representing individual generator output and interregional transmission flows. The chord diagrams provide a more quantitative view of the net interchange between each of the regions. The dispatch charts are stacked and grouped bar charts providing an instantaneous snapshot of the generation mix by ISO and scenario. 

This package was developed to analyze data from the [`Eastern Renewable Generation Integration Study (ERGIS)`](http://www.nrel.gov/grid/ergis.html). The kaleidoscope functions are generic; however, there are are a set of ERGIS-specific helper functions for utilizing the kaleidoscope functions for the data generated by ERGIS.

load('~/ergis/data/final_report/c_RT_dispatch_stack_data.RData')
c_RT_dispatch_stack_data$time = as.POSIXlt(format(c_RT_dispatch_stack_data$time, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"), tz="EST")
```

Load and/or define static ERGIS data

```
regions=readShapeSpatial('~/data/ergis/regions.shp', proj4string=CRS('+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0'))
ergis_generators = generators=read.csv('~/data/ergis/gen.csv', header=TRUE, sep=',')

centroids = read.csv('~/data/ergis/region-centroids.csv', header=T)
ergis_layout = layout = as.matrix(centroids[,2:3])
ergis_layout = as.matrix(centroids[,2:3])
ergis_verts = sapply(centroids$ISO, toString)

scenarios = data.frame('c_RT_loVG'='lowVG', 'c_RT_SRPS'='RTx10', 'c_RT_R30P'='RTx30', 'c_RT_N30P'='ITx30')
ergis_colors = data.table(type=c("Hydro", "Nuclear", "Coal", "Gas CC", "Wind", "CT/Gas boiler", "Other", "Pumped Storage", "PV", "CHP-QF", "Geothermal", "Storage", "Biomass", "CSP", "Steam", "DR", "RPV"),
                       color=c("#add8e6","#b22222","#333333","#6e8b3d","#4f94cd", "#ffb6c1","#8968cd", "#FFFFFF", "#ffc125", "gray20", "khaki1", "gray45", "mediumpurple2", "darkorange2", "orchid4", "gray60", "goldenrod2"))
ergis_iso = c("Saskatchewan", "PJM", "SPP", "NBSO", "SERC", "IESO", "ISO-NE", "Manitoba", "NYISO", "MISO", "HQ", "FRCC")
```
Plot the ERGIS generation map

```
t = as.POSIXlt("2006-11-24 14:25:00", tz="EST")

draw_density(t, 'None', ergis_generators, ergis_generation, ergis_colors)
draw_generators(t, c("Hydro", "Coal", "Gas CC", "Wind", "CT/Gas boiler", "Other", "Pumped Storage", "PV"), ergis_generators, ergis_generation, ergis_colors, scenario='c_RT_R30P', scaling=0.002)
draw_interchange(t, ergis_verts, ergis_layout, c_RT_netinterchange, c_RT_dispatch_stack_data, 'c_RT_R30P')
```
